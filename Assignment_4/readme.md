# CS7641 Assignment 4 - Reinforcement Learning and MDPs
This assignment will look at the reinforcment learning algorithms, namely the value iteration, policy iteration and Q Learning algorithms.

This assignment will also take a look at 2 different problems of varying sizes and characteristics. The first problem is the frozen lake (Grid World) problem and the second is the forest management (Non-Grid World) problem. 

For the frozen lake a 4x4 and 16x16 grid was chosen and for the forest management a 25 and 256 state problem was used. 

Some installation files have been modified to change the rewards and for giving stat output of runs. These modified files can be found in the modified code folder and the files need to be replaced in the relevant folders.

# Getting Started
For testing, a machine with python>=3.6 needs to be installed as well as the following packages:
pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, mdptoolbox-hiive, gym

# Running
To run the notebook, simply follow the steps.

Download and unzip the folder
1. Replace the files as stated in the modifed code folder.
2. Run the ipython notebook. To run simply hit the run all button.
