# CS7641 Assignment 3 - Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction
This assignment will look at the unsupervised learning algorithms, namely the K-Means and Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm.

This assignment will also take a look at dimensionality reduction methods which include 1) PCA, 2) ICA, 3) Randomized Projection (RP) and 4) Random Forest Feature importance.

This assignment can be split into 2 parts. The first part will look at the unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction methods and the second will involve using applying the clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques to a dataset which will be used for the neural network

# Part 1 - Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
For this part we will be using 2 datasets. The first dataset is the sklearn mnist dataset and the second is the heart disease dataset.

# Part 2 - Neural Network

For the neural network problem, we will be using this dataset. The .csv of the dataset is included in the repo.
Dataset : Heart Disease Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

# Getting Started
For testing, a machine with python>=3.6 needs to be installed as well as the following packages:
pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

# Running
To run the notebook, simply follow the steps.

Download and unzip the folder
Run the ipython notebook. To run simply hit the run all button. To save time, it is recommended to skip the gridsearch phase in order to speed up analysis.


# Addtional Info
The datasets have been uploaded to the repo to make it easy to find. Should you need additional info, links to the dataset have been included at the top
