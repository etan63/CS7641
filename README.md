# CS7641 Assignment 1 - Supervised Learning
The goal of this assignment is to look at how 5 different algorithms (ANN,SVM,KNN,Decision Trees and Boosted Trees) work on 2 different classification datasets.
The algorithms be applied on the 2 classifcation datasets and the results will be analysed and contrasted.

Dataset 1 : Heart Disease Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/heart-disease-uci/data

Dataset 2 : Credit Card Default Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset

# Getting Started
For testing, a machine with python>=3.6 needs to be installed as well as the following packages:
pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

# Running
Simply run the ipython notebook. To run simply hit the run all button. To save time, it is recommended to skip the gridsearch phase in order to speed up analysis.

# Addtional Info
The datasets are uploaded to the repo. Should you need additional info, links to the dataset have been included at the top
